> # Description
> 
> The objective of the team was to salvage digital assets (3d models, textures, audio, animations and others) and normalize them in order for them to be software agnostic. Once the assets were processed they were added to an internal digital asset manager library(DAM) to be used by the entire company.  Another objective was to add relevant metadata that will be used by the DAM search engine.
> 
> # Challenges
> 
> The assets to be salvaged came from a wide variety of production pipelines, different studios, softwares, sometimes different decades. The project was being worked on by a small team that had to come up with a new manual processing workflow for each new repository.
> 
> # Solution
> 
> I developed an ecosystem of tools to achieve the expected results in an optimized, scalable way that would be as adaptable as possible to future projects. Some of those tools were the Batch Sequencer, Tag Tool, Metadata Tool, Inventory Report Tool.

> Description
> 
> The Batch Sequencer is a node based, hierarchically organized asset processing tool based on Maxscript and Python that allows for the creation of highly elaborate action sequences both on the 3d scene and OS levels.
> 
> Key Points
> 
> -   A dynamic UI that allows the users to quickly reorganize, modify and test  new sequences was a major factor in the success and efficiency of the tool.
> 
> ---
> 
> -   The created action sequences, or manifests, are stored as XML templates.
> 
> ---
> 
> -   Each node is a self contained object that encapsulates all the necessary code to store, set and modify its parameters, draw its own UI and perform its own tasks.
> 
> ---
> 
> -   Due to its flexibility, this paradigm of action sequences ended up being the central hub where all automated task were launched from.
