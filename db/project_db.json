            "main": "This showcases the ongoing development of tools and pipelines for an undisclosed company's game. The game world is an expansive open world resembling a vast plain with farms and towns. Our project's focal points are swift iteration, optimal performance, and extensive customizability.",
            "challenges": "The primary challenges arise from the project's extensive scale. Encompassing an area exceeding 25 square kilometers, we are confronted with the demanding task of ensuring a high level of detail for a third-person view, which includes creating interiors for every building. With limited team resources, our central focus is on emphasizing swift iteration speed, delivering high-performance content, and ensuring user-friendliness for the designers.",
            "solutions": "I designed and implemented a procedural pipeline from scratch using Houdini and Unreal to create landscapes, towns, infrastructure, and more. Leveraging heightfields, SOP networks, PDG, VEX, and Python in Houdini, foundational data is generated. Subsequently, custom tools in Unreal facilitated the import of landscapes, towns, road networks, and more. Utilizing a range of tools, including World Partition, PCG, shaders, grass layers, RVTs, blueprints, custom editor widgets, and Niagara, elements throughout the world were efficiently spawned and edited."

Once the assets were processed they were added to an internal digital asset manager library(DAM) to be used by the entire company.\u00c2  Another objective was to add relevant metadata that will be used by the DAM search engine.",
            "challenges": " The assets to be salvaged came from a wide variety of production pipelines, different studios, softwares, sometimes different decades. The project was being worked on by a small team that had to come up with a new manual processing workflow for each new repository.",
            "solutions": "I developed an ecosystem of tools to achieve the expected results in an optimized, scalable way that would be as adaptable as possible to future projects. Some of those tools were the Batch Sequencer, Tag Tool, Metadata Tool, Inventory Report Tool."

Also, all the motion information had to be retargeted to our own rigs  ",
            "solutions": "I created a set of tools tha allowed to automatically sort files from different vendors, merge and process them to match the pipeline requirements. This allowed for a quick iteration and was the backbone for an agile system that allowd to process and iterate the hundreds of shots needed for every episode.

Secondly, creating reactive and interactive animals that felt like a part of the world. Thirdly, learning and setting up Ndisplay technology in collaboration with onsite operators was a hurdle. Finally, there was a need to come up with methods for rapidly iterating the level design and ambient animations.",

I also developed animation blueprints and AI controllers for the animals to create a seamless and interactive experience with the audience, collaborated with the onsite team to learn and set up Ndisplay technology, and designed a set of tools for rapid environment iteration. The result was a successful installation that engaged the audience and promoted Intel chips."

It features visually stunning VFX effects that can be manipulated and controlled by users' body movements and expressions, captured through a camera feed. The installation is projected onto a wall and boasts a dynamic room system that can be dynamically resized to fit into different real-world walls and animated during transitions between different effects. The project required expert knowledge of Unreal Engine 5, Mediapipe API, Python programming, and VFX pipeline.",
            "challenges": "The development of the project presented a multitude of complex technical challenges. The dynamic animation of the virtual room was a considerable challenge, given the variation in real-world sizes of the installation location. Therefore, a dynamic room system was developed that adapted to different real-world sizes without affecting transitions between effects. Additionally, the interpretation of Mediapipe information into useful interactions and the integration of different gestures with different Niagara VFX effects were technically demanding.",
            "solutions": "To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive solution was developed, comprising a dynamic room system in Unreal that could dynamically adapt to different real-world sizes without impacting transitions between effects. A Mediapipe Blueprint was developed, which could detect hand and body gestures and convert them into inputs for the system. Additionally, a sophisticated VFX pipeline was developed to seamlessly integrate these gestures with the different Niagara effects used in the installation. The project demonstrated the technical expertise and knowledge of the artist/developer in creating cutting-edge interactive installations that showcased the latest advancements in digital technologies."
