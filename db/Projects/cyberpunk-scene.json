    "responsibilities": [
      "Solely designed and built a medium-scale walkable 3D environment in Unreal Engine 5 using platform-generated assets.",
      "Utilized procedural content generation, custom shaders, and Blueprints to assemble and animate environmental elements and character actors.",
      "Set up lighting, VFX, and sequencer cinematics to produce a polished visual presentation.",
      "Integrated AI-generated character and prop assets into the scene and orchestrated their motion and interaction via Blueprints.",
      "Captured and exported a cinematic sequence using the Unreal Sequencer to showcase the visual and experiential quality of the environment."
    ],
    "context": "This project was a one-week internal validation to test the Atlas Platform’s ability to generate and assemble 3D assets into a cohesive Unreal Engine 5 scene. The environment takes the form of a techno-cyberpunk food court with dynamic lighting, rigged character actors, and visual effects.",
    "challenges": "Building a visually compelling, walkable environment under a tight time constraint required rapid iteration, robust scene layout tools, and seamless importation of platform-generated assets. Ensuring lighting, character motion, and VFX worked together without performance issues was also critical.",
    "solutions": "I leveraged procedural content generation, Blueprints, and custom shader work to quickly assemble and iterate the environment. Sequencer was used to craft a cinematic walkthrough that highlighted the platform’s asset quality and lighting fidelity. The result was a polished demo cinematic that validated the platform’s real-time capabilities.",
