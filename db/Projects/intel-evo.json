			"main": "Evolution Experience is an interactive installation in Spain that promotes Intel chips. Using Unreal Engine, I created an immersive experience featuring different species of animals that the audience can interact with via tablets. The installation consists of 8 projectors, forming a surround room.",
			"challenges": "The project presented a few main challenges. Firstly, it was necessary to integrate Unreal with a websocket server to enable audience interaction. Secondly, creating reactive and interactive animals that felt like a part of the world. Thirdly, learning and setting up Ndisplay technology in collaboration with onsite operators was a hurdle. Finally, there was a need to come up with methods for rapidly iterating the level design and ambient animations.",
			"solutions": "To overcome these challenges, I integrated a websocket plugin in Unreal. I also developed animation blueprints and AI controllers for the animals to create a seamless and interactive experience with the audience, collaborated with the onsite team to learn and set up Ndisplay technology, and designed a set of tools for rapid environment iteration. The result was a successful installation that engaged the audience and promoted Intel chips."
